how to use this fine piece of software:

-go to the releases tab and install the zip file<br>
-extract the contents into a folder (the "levels.csv" need to be in the same folder as the .exe)<br>
-open the game (only steam version tested so far)<br>
-you might need to add the program to your windows defender exception list<br>
-click on the downloaded .exe file<br>
-and then maybe it works<br>
